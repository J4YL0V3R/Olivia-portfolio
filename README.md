This portfolio will also serve as evidence for your assessment later in the year. Please read the following instructions carefully before beginning. --- 
## Project Overview This repository contains the template for your DTC Portfolio. You will update this portfolio as you complete each learning topic in class. - New topics are introduced every 1–2 weeks. - At the end of each topic, you must complete a checkpoint by updating your portfolio. 
### Checkpoint Requirements - Your portfolio must contain all learning and project material for that topic. - Your pages should be functional, tidy, and correctly linked. 
### If a Checkpoint Is Missed - You will be required to attend a mini‑chat with the teacher. - An email home will be sent to caregivers. These expectations ensure steady progress and prevent last‑minute workload pressure. ---
